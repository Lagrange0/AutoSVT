## 3D Virtual Simulation Framework for SOTIF Validation and Training in Autonomous Driving

AutoSVT is an open-source framework dedicated to enhancing the Safety of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF) of autonomous driving systems. It provides first-principles based 3D virtual simulation testing tools to discover adverse weather related corner cases.

For more detailed information and examples, please visit [AutoSVT's project website](https://idslab-autosec.github.io/).

## Features

### First-principles Based Simulation 
- Sensor modeling and interaction with the environment, integrated into the CARLA simulator.

### Discovering Adverse Weather Related Corner Cases 
- A meta-heuristic algorithm guides seed scenarios and mutations, reducing the search dimensions of scenarios.

### Synchronization For Multi-agent Collaborative Simulation 
- An eBPF-based synchronization mechanism bridges ADSes and the simulator, mitigating issues of false positives and negatives in asynchronous simulations.
